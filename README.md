# Simple-calculator
A very simple and some what less powerfull calculator for primary school grade mathematical operations!

Hai guys, Iam a high school student who is trying to learn python code online.
Then I wondered if my code could be exposed to an open source world. from where people can easily modify and add comments to it.
hope you would like it!

*The only executable file in this is our python file* .told you this is a simple learning out.

And this is truly for one who wants to have an example application for python tkinter package.
Hope you will find it helpful.
